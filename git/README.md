# What is Git?

Git is a **free and open source** distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is easy to to learn and has a **tiny footprint with lightning fast performance**. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like **cheap local branching**, conveninent **staging areas**, and **multiple workflows**.

Git also works as a **remote repository hosted on a server, with local replicas on which users work**. By this way, you always have local replicas in different local locations, which makes it very convenient in case something goes wrong and the remote repository is lost.

There are multiple web services where you can host your git repositories as public or private projects. This are some of the most used:

-   [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/) (_external link_)
-   [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) (_external link_)
-   [GitHub](https://github.com) (_external link_)

You can also use tools like [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (_external link_) that allows to show and manage git branches through a visual interface.

# About Git

There are some features that makes git a different SCM tool:

-   **Branching and Merging**: Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds.

-   **Small and fast**: Git is fast. With Git, nearly all operations are performed locally, giving it a huge speed advantage on centralized systems that constantly have to communicate with a server somewhere.

-   **Distributed**: One of the nicest features of any Distributed SCM, Git included, is that it's distributed. This means that instead of doing a "checkout" of the current tip of the source code, you do a "clone" of the entire repository.

-   **Data Assurance**: The data model that Git uses ensures the cryptographic integrity of every bit of your project. Every file and commit is checksummed and retrieved by its checksum when checked back out. It's impossible to get anything out of Git other than the **exact bits you put in**.

-   **Staging Area**: Git has something called the "staging area" or "index". This is an intermediate area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completing the commit.

-   **Free and Open Source**: Git is released under the **GNU General Public License version 2.0**, which is an **open source license**. The Git project chose to use GPLv2 to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software - to make sure the software is free for all its users.

Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their histories diverged from the current branch) into the 
current branch.

**Examples**
```
git merge branchname
```

### git-stash
Stash the changes in a dirty working directory away.

**Description**

Use this command when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back 
to a clean working directory.

# Git Flow

**Git Flow** is a workflow designed by Vincent Driessen and published at nvie.com:

https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

The git flow workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. Provides a robust framework 
for managing projects.

Git flow is suited for projects that have scheduled release cycle.

**Documentation**

-   **Git Flow Cheat Sheet** - https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/index.html Available in multiple languages (_external link_)
-   **Bitbucket Gitflow Workflow** - https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow (_external link_)

## Basic tips

-   Git flow provides excellent command line help and output.
-   The macOS/Windows Client **SourceTree** is an excellent git gui and provides git-flow support.
-   Git-flow is a merge based solution. It doesn't rebase feature branches.

## Setup

-   You need a working git installation as prerequisite.
-   Git flow works on macOS, Linux and Windows.

**macOS**

Homebrew:
```
brew install git-flow-avh
```

Macports:
```
port install git-flow-avh
```

**Linux**
```
apt-get install git-flow
```

**Windows (Cygwin)**
```
wget -q -O - --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh/develop/contrib/gitflow-installer.sh install stable | bash
```
You need wget and util-linux to install git-flow.

## Getting started

Git flow needs to be initialized in order to customize your project setup.

**Initialize**

Start using git-flow by initializing it inside an existing git repository:
```
git flow init
```

## Features

Development of new features starting from the 'develop' branch.

**Start a new feature**

Start developing a new feature with:
```
git flow feature start MYFEATURE
```

**Finish up a feature**

Finish the development of a feature. This action performs the following:
-   Mergest MYFEATURE into 'develop'
-   Removes the feature branch
-   Switches back to 'develop' branch
```
git flow feature finish MYFEATURE
```

**Publish a feature**

Are you developing a feature in collaboration?

Publish a feature to the remote server so it can be used by other users.
```
git flow feature publish MYFEATURE
```

**Getting a published feature

Get a feature published by another user.
```
git flow feature pull origin MYFEATURE
```

You can track a feature on origin by using:
```
git flow feature track MYFEATURE
```

## Make a release

-   Support preparation of a new production release.
-   Allow for minor bug fixes and preparing meta-data for a release.

**Start a release**

To start a release, use the git flow release command. It creates a release branch created from the 'develop' branch.
```
git flow release start RELEASE [BASE]
```

It's wise to publish the release branch after creating it to allow release commits by other developers. Do it similar to feature publishing with the command:
```
git flow release publish RELEASE
```

**Finish up a release**

Finishing a release is one of the big steps in git branching. It performs several actions:

-   Merges the release branch back into 'master'
-   Tags the release with its name
-   Back-merges the release into 'develop'
-   Removes the release branch
```
git flow release finish RELEASE
```
Don't forget to push your tags with `git push origin --tags`

## Hotfixes

-   Hotfixes arise from the necessity to act immediately upon an undesired state of a live production version
-   May be branched off from the corresponding tag on the master branch that marks the production version.

**git flow hotfix start**

Like the other git flow commands, a hotfix is started with:
```
git flow hotfix start VERSION [BASENAME]
```

**Finish a hotfix**

By finishing a hotfix it gets merged back into develop and master. Additionally the master merge is tagged with the hotfix version.
```
git flow hotfix finish VERSION
```
